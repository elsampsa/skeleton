# A small cpp extension here

You may use
```
compile.bash
runswig.bash
```
to test that the cpp build process works.

The actual compilation is done by ```setup.py``` at installation time at your target machine.

Use ```make.bash``` in the main directory to create a package.  It also puts the python part of this module in-place (the autogenerated sharedmem.py)
