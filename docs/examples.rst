Examples
========

If you are creating big-time examples of how to use your module, the best idea is to create a separate repository for them, in this case it would be called "skeleton-examples".

For a bit smaller example project you might opt for an examples submodule, i.e. for "skeleton.examples"

Here we are considering example *snippets*, i.e. small and compact example programs to get the api user exited.  Here is an example:

The following python code can be downloaded from :download:`[here]<snippets/example1.py>`

.. include:: snippets/example1.py_

Check out directory "docs/snippets/".  It servers as a collection for small example programs.  Open and edit "form_snippets.bash" there.  You can then run it.  Remember to recompile the documentation once you have done that.
